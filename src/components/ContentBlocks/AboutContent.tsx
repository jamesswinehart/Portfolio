      <p>I&apos;m James, a student at Princeton studying Computer Science and English, originally from Columbus, Georgia.</p>
      <p>At my core, I am a creator. I believe in building things that are just as beautiful in form as they are powerful in function. I love envisioning what could exist, and I work to make those ideas real â€” whether that be a business, an app, a brand, or a story.</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore this site to learn about everyone, everywhere, and everything that has shaped who I am, where I&apos;ve been, and what I do. And if you&apos;d like to ask any questions, work with me, or just chat, I would love for you to reach out! Feel free to contact me here.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to knowing you,</p>
