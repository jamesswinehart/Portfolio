    <Section id="projects" title="Everything I've Developed">
      <p>My projects are inspired by the intersection of tech and creativity. My work tends to play around with fun ideas, design-obsessed interfaces, and interactive experiences.</p>
      <p>I'm super interested in HCI interfaces, quirky AI assistants, and business automation. Feel free to check out some of my work below. You can also visit my Github <a href="https://github.com/jamesswinehart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 600}}>here.</a></p>

      <h3>KnowBody</h3>
      <PhotoGallery items={knowbodyProject} />
      <p>KnowBody is a full-stack, HIPAA-compliant iOS app built with Swift and Firebase. It functions like a social network for physicians, allowing primary care doctors to instantly ping local specialists for free, on-demand medical advice.</p>
      <p>The app was made in collaboration with MercyMed of Columbus, a non-profit healthcare clinic providing high-quality, low-cost healthcare to the underserved. The project is currently in development and moving toward official, legal recognition as a secure medical platform.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Avaline</h3>
      <PhotoGallery items={avalineProject} />
      <p>Avaline is a concert ticket web-scraper built with React that pulled live data from StubHub and SeatGeek to deliver real-time updates, price tracking, and AI-powered purchasing advice. It helped me and dozens of other Oasis fans secure tickets to the bandâ€™s East Rutherford reunion concert.</p>
      <p>With the show now behind us, Avaline's price-tracking features have gone quiet. But the app allowed me to attend the concert (which was awesome), and you can still chat with the British AI assistant Avaline <a href="https://avaline.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 600}}>here.</a></p>
